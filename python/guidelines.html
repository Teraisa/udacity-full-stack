<div class="cooked"><p>Hi Fellow Udacians,</p>

<p>Although this is a rather long post, I want to share a few points that I think are easily overlooked when completing your movie trailer site (esp with all that you're already learning at this point). </p>

<p>Double check these before you submit your project for review!</p>

<h2>Pep8:</h2>

<hr>

<p>Python's style guide <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow">Pep8<span class="badge badge-notification clicks" title="370 clicks">370</span></a> is used to make sure that we write consistent, readable, and maintainable code.  </p>

<p>There are a number of things to check, and I've detailed a few of the most common here:</p>

<p><br></p>

<ul><li>
<strong><em>The  <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#maximum-line-length" rel="nofollow">maximum line length<span class="badge badge-notification clicks" title="78 clicks">78</span></a> is 80 characters.</em></strong> It's common to be programming and write a line as such: </li></ul>

<p></p><pre><code class="hljs ini"><span class="hljs-attr">my_object</span> = objectConstructor(<span class="hljs-string">"This is an argument that is a really really long string that defines something, but goes past 80 characters......"</span>, argument2, argument3)</code></pre>

<p><br></p>

<p>As you can see, you have to scroll horizontally to read the code, and this dimenishes readability. Lets refactor:<br></p>

<p></p><pre><code class="hljs nginx"><span class="hljs-attribute">new_object</span> = objectConstructor(<span class="hljs-string">"This is an argument that is a really really"</span>
                               <span class="hljs-string">" long string that defines something, but stays"</span>
                               <span class="hljs-string">" under 80 characters......"</span>,
                               argument2, argument3)</code></pre>

<p>Hopefully, this is evident in being more easily read than the first example.</p>

<p>Note that urls are an exception here. Don't split a url over two lines, instead <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5033727/how-do-i-get-pyflakes-to-ignore-a-statement" rel="nofollow">add the comment <code># NOQA</code><span class="badge badge-notification clicks" title="662 clicks">662</span></a> to the end to suppress linter warnings.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>In other cases the method signature --the <code>myMethod(arg1, arg2, etc)</code> bit of code-- or a dict or array declaration passes 80 characters. You can resolve this by moving arguments to a new line as such:<br></p>

<p></p><pre><code class="hljs apache"><span class="hljs-comment"># With a method signature:</span>
<span class="hljs-attribute">new_object</span>.myMethod(long_argument1, long_argument2, long_argument3,
                    <span class="hljs-attribute">long_argument4</span>, long_argument5, etc...)

<span class="hljs-comment"># And with an array:</span>
<span class="hljs-attribute">my_array</span> =<span class="hljs-meta"> [long_array_element1, long_array_element2, long_array_element3,
            long_array_element4, long_array_element5, etc...]</span></code></pre>

<p><br></p>

<ul><li><strong>Whitespace near comments:</strong></li></ul>

<p>It's good practice to document your code with comments, and block and inline comments are great places to start. However, the following will throw two errors.<br></p>

<p></p><pre><code class="hljs bash"><span class="hljs-comment">#My really awesome comment that needs a space</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> foo &lt; bar:<span class="hljs-comment"># This inline comment is too close.</span>
    <span class="hljs-built_in">print</span> <span class="hljs-string">"Hello world!"</span></code></pre>

<p>Lets refactor as:<br></p>

<p></p><pre><code class="hljs bash"><span class="hljs-comment"># My awesome comment that now has a space between the # symbol and text</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> foo &lt; bar:  <span class="hljs-comment"># This inline comment has 2 spaces now!</span>
    <span class="hljs-built_in">print</span> <span class="hljs-string">"Hi again!"</span></code></pre>

<p><br><br>There are many other aspects of writing pep8 compliant code, but these are the most common. Be sure to watch this great <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf-BqAjZb8M" rel="nofollow">PyCon talk<span class="badge badge-notification clicks" title="101 clicks">101</span></a> on Pep8 by Raymond Hettinger and see the <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html" rel="nofollow">PyGuide<span class="badge badge-notification clicks" title="64 clicks">64</span></a> for more information.</p>

<p>As this can be tedious work, check out <a href="http://pep8online.com/" rel="nofollow">pep8online<span class="badge badge-notification clicks" title="143 clicks">143</span></a> to quickly check a snippet and the tool <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/autopep8/" rel="nofollow">autopep8<span class="badge badge-notification clicks" title="132 clicks">132</span></a> to catch and fix any errors for your entire project. Also, if you use sublime text as your editor your can integrate this into your workflow via package control.</p>

<h2>README:</h2>

<hr>

<p>Readmes are a central piece of documentation for your project. They are often the first place that a user will look when coming to your codebase. </p>

<ul>
<li>Did you include a readme?</li>
<li>Does this readme give the user instructions on how to get started running your python code to generate their own HTML page?</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are a few resources that will get you started writing great readmes:<br>- Udacity's <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/writing-readmes--ud777" rel="nofollow">Writing READMEs class<span class="badge badge-notification clicks" title="692 clicks">692</span></a><br>- <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2304863/how-to-write-a-good-readme" rel="nofollow">Stack Overflow: How to write a good README<span class="badge badge-notification clicks" title="586 clicks">586</span></a><br>- <a href="https://github.com/matiassingers/awesome-readme" rel="nofollow">Awesome-readme repo<span class="badge badge-notification clicks" title="317 clicks">317</span></a>. Examples of great readmes on Github.<br>- <a href="https://orchestrate.io/blog/2014/07/16/how-to-write-a-readme-worth-reading/" rel="nofollow">Blog Post: How to Write a Readme Worth Reading<span class="badge badge-notification clicks" title="217 clicks">217</span></a></p>

<p><br><br><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> Markdown is a very helpful format that makes displaying your readme easier, and it is typically used for readmes.</p>

<p>To format your readme as a markdown file, you'll need to save it as  <code>readme.md</code> (with a <code>.md</code> file extension). See <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/" rel="nofollow">Github's guide<span class="badge badge-notification clicks" title="120 clicks">120</span></a> and this <a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet" rel="nofollow">cheat sheet<span class="badge badge-notification clicks" title="154 clicks">154</span></a> for more on how to use markdown. Also check out <a href="http://dillinger.io/" rel="nofollow">dillinger.io<span class="badge badge-notification clicks" title="76 clicks">76</span></a> to view and edit markdown in your browser.</p>

<h2>Comments:</h2>

<hr>

<p>We've already mentioned comments, but let's go into more detail.</p>

<p>Comments are an important element of any readable and maintainable codebase. Often we will use these to tell other developers what the following section of code does or how it does it.</p>

<ul><li>
<strong>Block and inline comments:</strong> (PyGuide <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#Comments" rel="nofollow">here<span class="badge badge-notification clicks" title="43 clicks">43</span></a>)</li></ul>

<p></p><pre><code class="hljs python"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">IOTask</span>:</span>
    <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title">terminate</span><span class="hljs-params">(self)</span>:</span>
        self._running = <span class="hljs-keyword">False</span>

    <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title">run</span><span class="hljs-params">(self, sock)</span>:</span>
        <span class="hljs-comment"># sock is a socket</span>
        sock.settimeout(<span class="hljs-number">5</span>)        <span class="hljs-comment"># Set timeout period</span>
        <span class="hljs-keyword">while</span> self._running:
            <span class="hljs-comment"># Perform a blocking I/O operation w/ timeout</span>
            <span class="hljs-keyword">try</span>:
                data = sock.recv(<span class="hljs-number">8192</span>)
                <span class="hljs-keyword">break</span>
            <span class="hljs-keyword">except</span> socket.timeout:
                <span class="hljs-keyword">continue</span>
            <span class="hljs-comment"># Continued processing</span>
            ...
        <span class="hljs-comment"># Terminated</span>
        <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span></code></pre>

<p>This code is taken from page 487 of the <a href="http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000393" rel="nofollow">Python Cookbook<span class="badge badge-notification clicks" title="22 clicks">22</span></a>, and while what the code is doing isn't relevant here, take a look at the use of comments. These make it relatively easy to have a cursory grasp of what the code is doing just at a glance.</p>

<p><br></p>

<ul><li>
<strong>DocStrings:</strong> (<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/#multi-line-docstrings" rel="nofollow">Pep8 documentation<span class="badge badge-notification clicks" title="43 clicks">43</span></a>)<br>Docstrings are a special kind comment. Their advantage is that a class's or method's docstring can be accessed via the <code>__doc__</code> attribute. For instance:</li></ul>

<p></p><pre><code class="hljs python"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">myClass</span><span class="hljs-params">(object)</span>:</span>
    <span class="hljs-string">"""This is a example showing docstrings
    
    Attributes:
        attr1 (str): This should say something about attr1.
        attr2 (int): This should tell the purpose of attr2 
    
    Etc....
    """</span>

    self.attr1 = <span class="hljs-string">"My String!"</span>
    self.attr2 = <span class="hljs-number">42</span>

<span class="hljs-keyword">print</span> myClass.__doc__</code></pre>

<p>would output:<br></p>

<p></p><pre><code class="hljs perl">This is a example showing docstrings
    
    Attributes:
        attr1 (str): This should <span class="hljs-keyword">say</span> something about attr1.
        attr2 (<span class="hljs-keyword">int</span>): This should <span class="hljs-keyword">tell</span> the purpose of attr2 
    
    Etc....</code></pre>

<p>This can also be done on methods, and the use of docstrings is super helpful in readability as well as debugging.</p>

<p>Check out <a href="http://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.org/en/latest/example_google.html" rel="nofollow">this resource<span class="badge badge-notification clicks" title="68 clicks">68</span></a> if you would like to see addition examples of docstrings.</p>

<p><br></p>

<h2>Testing:</h2>

<hr>

<p>Testing is one tool that software developers use to ensure their code does what is supposed to. There are many approaches and methodologies to this. In our case, we simply should ensure that running our code has the desired effect of generating an html page. Definitely run your code to ensure that it works.</p>

<p>As the applications you develop evolve, your testing tools should too. See Udacity's <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/software-testing--cs258" rel="nofollow">Testing Software<span class="badge badge-notification clicks" title="139 clicks">139</span></a> course and <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/agile/testing" rel="nofollow">Engineering higher quality through<br>agile testing practices<span class="badge badge-notification clicks" title="77 clicks">77</span></a> by Atlassian for more.</p>

<p>By the way: Once you receive feedback from your review, it'll come in two sections </p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Project Review:</strong> this is where you find general feedback about your project and things that might not be specific to a particular line(s) of code.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Code Review:</strong> Feedback on specific areas of code. ("Required", "Suggestion", or "Awesome") This is where some of the most useful points of improvement are often located.</p></li>
</ul></div>
